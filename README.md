# BANK_API

This project was built as a test for an interview. The goal was to build an Ruby on Rails API with three end-points:

- create_account: let you create a bank account
- create_transaction: let you create transactions (credit or debit) for the bank accounts
- list_transactions: let you list all the transactions that happened in a bank account

System requirements:

- Ruby 2.7.2
- Rails 7.0.3
- Postgresql
- jsonapi
- validates_timeliness
- validators
